Here's a polished and professional `README.md` for your **Customer Churn Modeling using Artificial Neural Network** GitHub repository. You can copy and adjust it as needed:

# 🧠 Customer Churn Prediction Using ANN

This project aims to **predict customer churn** (whether a customer will leave the company) using an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** built with **TensorFlow/Keras**. The model is trained on real-world banking data and is deployed via a **Streamlit web app** for easy user interaction.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset `Churn_Modelling.CSV` includes the following key features:

- CustomerID, CreditScore, Geography, Gender
- Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts
- HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary
- **Exited** (Target variable: 1 = Churned, 0 = Retained)

---

## 📦 Requirements

Install the necessary libraries using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Libraries Used:**
- `tensorflow`
- `keras`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `tensorboard`
- `matplotlib`
- `streamlit`
- `scikeras`

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### 1. Train the Model (Optional)

To retrain the model:

```bash
python experiments.py
```

This saves the model to `model.h5`.

### 2. Launch the Streamlit App

To start the UI for churn prediction:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

You can input customer details, and the app will predict whether the customer is likely to churn or stay.

## 🔍 Additional Features

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  
  `hyperparametertuningann.py` uses `GridSearchCV` with `KerasClassifier` to optimize model performance.

- **Salary Regression Module:**  
  `Salaryregression.py` predicts a customer’s estimated salary based on selected features using regression techniques.

## 🧠 Model Overview

- Input: Processed customer data
- Architecture: Fully-connected ANN
- Output: Binary classification – Churn (1) or Not (0)
- Optimization: Adam optimizer, binary crossentropy loss

---

## ✅ To-Do

- Implement LIME/SHAP for interpretability
- Enhance the model with feature engineering
- Add salary regression into Streamlit interface
- Deploy app on Hugging Face Spaces or Streamlit Cloud
